        When not coding, you will find me lost in the world of music, playing
        drums, bass, and guitar as I love experimenting with different
        sub-genres of rock music. Fitness is my sanctuary, as I embrace going to
        gym, long-distance running and calisthenics. I cherish moments with
        loved ones, constantly seek knowledge through reading, and believe in
        the power of continuous growth.
